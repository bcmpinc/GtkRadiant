GtkRadiant 1.6 aka ZeroRadiant

[Legend: + = new, * = changed, - = removed]

day month year, GtkRadiant 1.6.x

* Lift undo limits:
  Before: max undo = 64,   default = 30;   max undo memory = 2MB
  After:  max undo = 2048, default = 1024; max undo memory = 16MB

* Fix some torn off menus loosing their bindings in their label (functionality
  was still there)

+ Add undo protection to texture rotation, scaling and shifting

+ Patches by AEon:
  - Allow CTRL-SHIFT cursor keys to shift textures always by one grid unit
  - Support numeric keypad keys for changing the grid

+ Always mark a map as modified after an undo-able action
  has been recorded (instead of starting to cluttering the
  whole code with explicit calls to do that).

* Disable color scaling when changing entity color from color chooser.
  Previously, the RGB colors were always normalized to
  the highest value of one of the RGB color values.

+ Clear undo history when loading or creating a new map.

* Don't clear undo history when opening preference dialog
  Previously the undo history was completely trashed *always*.
  Now we only trash it if the undo buffer actually changes
  *and* is less than the current number of undo levels in the
  buffer.

+ Added ability to undo the following operations:
  - nudge any selection
  - Entities dialog:
    - changing entity clas
    - changing key/val
    - deleting key/val
    - reset entity
    - changing to preset angle

+ Sync main window title with undo/redo and on disk saved states
  Previously this was never really in sync. After saving a map,
  doing undo/redo operation still marked the map as being modified
  although it matched the last saved state on disk.

* Fix undo loosing entities.
  If you moved a fixedsize entity (e.g. light, ammo, etc.) and undo'd the
  operation, only the brush used for interacting was undo'd, not the entity
  itself, it remained in its original position. Reported by Rambetter.

+ [Linux] Re-worked File Open dialog, use GtkFileChooserDialog,
  add file filters.

* Fix crash when loading or importing maps from files without extension.

+ Textool plugin: texture dialog can now be resized, mouse wheel
  supports zooming.

+ Ported from 1.5: Alternative algorithm to draw the grid.
  Major and minor grid steps are now differently drawn on lower zoom levels too.
  Doesn't play nice with the "Q3Radiant Original" theme.
  Is off by default, enable in preferences (2D Display/Rendering).

* [Windows] Fix and enable gtkgensurf plugin.

* [Windows] Enable PrtView plugin.

* [Windows] Enable ufoai plugin.

* [Windows] Enable hydratoolz, fix and enable vfswad

* [Windows] Enable spritemodel plguin.

* [Windows] Fix and enable bobtoolz plugin.

* [Windows] Fix and enable textool plugin.

* Fix crashes in textool plugin

* [Windows] Enable bkgrnd2d plugin.

* [Linux] Fix loading of models with upper case letters in path name
  This is an intrinsic change and probably affects all file loading
  paths. This change also leads to mixed case letters now showing up
  in a model entity path name. Reported by Rambetter.

* [Linux] Fix crash and data loss when saving shader, reported by Rambetter.

* Fix crash in model plugin when shut down or loading new map.

* Fix race condition crash: cannot open prefs when no game is selected. 

+ Add Undo/Redo to toolbar

+ Add pref for specifying a pango font string for the font used in the ortho
  and texture browser view. The config key is "GlFont", the string needs to be
  a format pango can parse.
  Example: "Arial 10". If the given font descriptor can't be resolved, the
  application reverts to the default "courier 8"
  Note: there's *no* GUI for that yet 

+ Store state of crosshair (activate/deactivate with SHIFT-X) in local.conf

+ Ported from 1.5: Added camera forward/backward strafe in freemode when
  pressing and holding CTRL-SHIFT. Added GUI pref to invert default behavior

+ Ported from 1.5: Added fixed texture size option for texture browser
  The fixed size defaults to 128 and can be manually change through
  the "TextureUniformSize" key in local.conf
